# Advanced-Driver-Assistance-System (ADAS)
This project is made to assist the drivers in night-time conditions by taillight and headlight detection and alert driver in case of collision risk with front vehicles. I have used Image processing techniques rather than using deep learning methods to make system affordable to users with less computation power required.
# This repository includes-
1. Tailight detection code.
2. Headlight detection code.
3. Outputs.
